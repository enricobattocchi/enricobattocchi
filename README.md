In 2007 I started developing [Duplicate Post](https://wordpress.org/plugins/duplicate-post/), which over time has become one of the most popular plugins for WordPress.

[Since June 2020](https://yoast.com/announcement-duplicate-post-joins-yoast/) I have followed my creation in joining [Yoast](https://yoast.com/), where I work as a web developer.
